      Healthcare is expensive, or is it?
    </h2>
    <p class="text-to-left">
      <strong>The main reason</strong> we experience high healthcare costs is
      because prices for healthcare services are not available before we receive
      care. <strong>We find out</strong> how much we’re required to pay after
      we’ve already received care. We cannot where we get care based on price.
      If we could do so, we would choose lower priced providers. And healthcare
      would not seem as expensive.

      While doctor prices are not usually available,
      <strong> we can avoid utilizing high-cost providers with shopMD </strong
      >.<br /><strong>The difference</strong> between high- and low-cost
      providers can be <strong>50%-90%</strong>. In other words, something that
      costs a few hundred dollars at one provider could cost a few thousand
      dollars at another.<br />
      <strong>shopMD is the easiest way</strong> to circumvent the price
      transparency barrier in healthcare. We do this
      <strong> by exposing low-cost specialty </strong> providers across the US.

      <li>Specialty care generates high costs for patients.</li>
      <li>Specialtysts’ prices are higher than primary care doctors.</li>
      <li>
        Specialty care is a more involved patient journey that can require
        follow up visits, tests and procedures that add costs cumulatively.
        Specialty care is mostly considered non-preventative for insurance
        purposes, and not covered as well under most commercial insurance plans.

    <h2 class="block__heading text-to-left">Timing is Everything!</h2>
    <p class="text-to-left">
      Another reason <strong>patients can save a lot</strong> by taking control
      of their specialty care journey is that
      <strong> specialty care encounters can be planned.<br /> </strong>
      Unlike emergent care or sudden hospitalization from unexpected events,
      most specialty care is outpatient and can be planned in advance. This
      gives patients time to <strong>decide how and where</strong> they choose
      to get care. It gives them the time and opportunity to explore low-cost
      options on shopMD.
