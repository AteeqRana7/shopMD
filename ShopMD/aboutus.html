          The price difference can be 50% or more between high- and low-cost
          providers. This can mean saving thousands of dollarsin some cases for
          a single encounter, and even tens of thousands of dollars in others.
          Costs are not an indicator of quality.High costs are usually the
          result of high margins and administrative overhead costs which get
          passed on to the patient.

            Healthcare Does Not Have to be Expensive
          </h2>
          <p class="hero__tagline">
            The biggest complaint about the US healthcare system is high costs.
            Increasingly, patients are directly bearing these costs as High
            Deductible Health Plans (HDHP) and coinsurance gain prevalence. Most
            of us pay higher out-of-pocket costs than we should

          Healthcare is expensive, or is it?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-to-left">
          <strong>The main reason</strong> we experience high healthcare costs
          is because prices for healthcare services are not available before we
          receive care. <strong>We find out</strong> how much we’re required to
          pay after we’ve already received care. We cannot where we get care
          based on price. If we could do so, we would choose lower priced
          providers. And healthcare would not seem as expensive.

          While doctor prices are not usually available,
          <strong>
            we can avoid utilizing high-cost providers with shopMD </strong
          >.<br /><strong>The difference</strong> between high- and low-cost
          providers can be <strong>50%-90%</strong>. In other words, something
          that costs a few hundred dollars at one provider could cost a few
          thousand dollars at another.<br />
          <strong>shopMD is the easiest way</strong> to circumvent the price
          transparency barrier in healthcare. We do this
          <strong> by exposing low-cost specialty </strong> providers across the
          US.

          <li>
            Specialty care is a more involved patient journey that can require
            follow up visits, tests and procedures that add costs cumulatively.
            Specialty care is mostly considered non-preventative for insurance
            purposes, and not covered as well under most commercial insurance
            plans.

        <p class="text-to-left">
          Another reason <strong>patients can save a lot</strong> by taking
          control of their specialty care journey is that
          <strong> specialty care encounters can be planned.<br /> </strong>
          Unlike emergent care or sudden hospitalization from unexpected events,
          most specialty care is outpatient and can be planned in advance. This
          gives patients time to <strong>decide how and where</strong> they
          choose to get care. It gives them the time and opportunity to explore
          low-cost options on shopMD.
